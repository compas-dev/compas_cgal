# Mesh Skeletonization with Vertex Mapping

This example demonstrates how to compute the geometric skeleton of a triangle mesh with vertex correspondence mapping using COMPAS CGAL.

Key Features:

* Computing skeleton with vertex correspondence information
* Understanding which original mesh vertices map to each skeleton vertex
* Colored visualization showing vertex mapping
* Printing mapping statistics to understand the correspondence
